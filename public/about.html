<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I am 24 years old, full-time working guy, living in Canada. I try to work hard to achieve my goals in life.
   Some of my best interests are sports like cricket and football, watching reality based movies and shows,
    and, travelling new places with family and friends.</p>

<p>A day in my life looks like waking up early, having my coffee and shower. Then, i go to work,
   and after coming back, i usually take a nap. Afterwards, i prepare myself i healthy meal and head to gym 
  for my daily workout.</p>

<p>However, my weekends are a bit different. I try to go really easy on me during weekends. So, no workout on
  weekends definately. I mostly eat outside during weekends, try to visit at least one new place because this is 
  something that really gives me happiness, and, motivation for working hard for the coming week.</p>
